        <div className="leading-relaxed tracking-wider">
          In the heart of Germany, 1992 , my journey began in a world just
          opening its eyes to the digital dawn. Planted in a family with roots
          reaching back to Turkey, I sprouted as a fresh chapter in a story
          woven from dreams and determination. My childhood, untainted by the
          digital saturation of the future, was rich with adventures that shape
          you, leaving impressions deep in the soul.

        </div>
        <div>
          Among those memories, the Great Bicycle Catastrophe stands out
          vividly. As the eager, youngest member of our little gang, my quest
          for candy ended with a lesson in innovation's pitfalls when my foot
          got caught in the bike's chain. That painful moment kindled a spark in
          me to reimagine and rebuild later in my life as a young adult,
          igniting an early passion for seeing beyond the given, asking, "What
          if?" and "Why not?".

        </div>
        <div>
          The childhood fantasy of football glory gently gave way to the stark
          landscape of adult expectations. My parents, armed with love and
          visions of a secure future, charted a course they believed best. Yet,
          beneath their well-meaning dreams, a restless energy bubbled within
          me, a silent yearning to carve my own path, to march to the beat of my
          own heart.

          The apprenticeship that followed was a tapestry of highs and lows -
          tedious reports on the one hand but invaluable friendships on the
          other. It was in the laughter and shared challenges that I discovered
          the true essence of work lies not in the tasks but in the human
          connections forged in the midst of routine.

          My university years were a quest through the confluence of technology,
          biology, and chemistry. Engaging with projects like filtering the
          brain's subtle signals through EEG, I embraced the thrill of challenge
          and discovery. Wrestling with hydrogels, crafting compact circuits,
          and decoding programming scripts became milestones on my journey, each
          obstacle a stepping stone towards greater understanding.

          of neuroscience, every book fueled my endless curiosity, encouraging
          me to venture ever deeper into the unknown.

        <div>
          Looking back, my path is a mosaic of ambition, resilience, and an
          undying thirst for knowledge. Inspired by Jigoro Kano, the judo
          pioneer who wished to be buried in his white belt as a symbol of a
          perpetual learning, I too adopt this philosophy of endless growth and
          humility. Kano's final wish, embracing the white belt's symbolism of a
          learner for life, mirrors my own desire to remain a student of the
          world, ever curious, ever evolving.

          In weaving this narrative, I've aimed to capture the essence of my
          journey from my childhood marked by simplicity and imagination,
          through trials of education and professional exploration to a present
          defined by curiosity and continuous learning. It's a story not of
          linear success but of learning, adapting, and finding purpose in the
          pursuit of innovation and understanding. This journey, reflective not
          of a straight line but of a series of meandering paths and unexpected
          detours, embodies the true spirit of exploration and growth - a
          testament to the beauty of life's unpredictable nature.
