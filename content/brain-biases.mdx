I was born in 1992, six months before the World Wide Web became accessible to the general public.
Since then, technology has advanced at a breathtaking pace, transforming the way we live, work, and connect.
I watched as wireless phones and cell phones grew smaller and more portable - only for smartphones like the IPhone to completely disrupt how we communicate.
Televisions became slimmer, sharper, and evolved into OLED displays.
Laptops became sleeker and more powerful. Now, generative AI and large language models can write, create, and process at speeds unimaginable just a decade ago.
The environment we live in is changing faster and faster, and this acceleration shows no signs of slowing down.
Yet here's the paradox: while technology leaps forward, our brains remain wired as they were in the Neanderthal era.
They are not equipped to process the sheer volume and velocity of modern information.\
Consider this: every second, our brains receive around 11 bits of sensory information, but we can only consciously process 50 bits per second.
That's like trying to collect a teaspoonful of water from Niagara Falls. The rest is filtered out, leaving us with just a fraction of reality.
To illustrate, imagine a library with 220,000 books, representing all the information our brains receive every second. Out of those books, we'd read just one single word from a single page in one book.
That's how little we consciously process compared to what's available to us.

To manage this overwhelming flood of information, our brains rely on mental shortcuts, or heuristics, to make decisions quickly and efficiently.
However, these shortcuts come at a cost: they often lead to cognitive biases - systematic errors in thinking and judgement that distort our perception of reality.
But the problem isn't just about filtering information and shortcuts. It's also about how our brains are structured.\
The human brain can be divided broadly into three main parts:

<Listcomponent
  type="ordered"
  items={[
    <>
      <strong>The Neocortex:</strong> The rational, thinking brain,
      responsible for logic, reasoning, and higher-level analysis.
    </>,
    <>
      <strong>The Limbic system</strong> (including the amygdala):  Often called the emotional brain, it processes feelings like fear, pleasure, and anger and reacts far faster than the rational neocortex.
    </>,
    <>
      <strong>The Brainstem</strong> (also known as the reptilian brain):  The instinctive brain that controls survival functions like fight-or-flight responses and vital bodily processes.
    </>

These three regions often conflict with each other. While the neocortex strives for logic and reason, the limbic system can override it with emotional responses, driven by fear, excitement, or deeply ingrained past experiences.
In a world where technology advances at mind-bowling speed, but our brains evolve at a glacial pace, this internal conflict between rational thought, emotional reaction , and instinct becomes a key driver of cognitive biases.
These biases aren't just quirks of human thinking - they are the byproducts of a brain struggling to adapt to a world it was never designed for.

In the early 1980s, a groundbreaking research field emerged: behavioral finance. Pioneered by Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman, this field demonstrated how cognitive biases unconsciously lead to poor decisions-making.
Their research showed that human judgement is systematically influenced by errors and deviations from rationality. Building on this foundation, researchers like Hersh Shefrin categorized these distortions into groups such as heuristics and framing effects.
While existing works have made significant contributions to understanding cognitive biases, many approaches remain limited to two-dimensional frameworks, focusing on the interplay between cognition and emotion.

In this article, we go a step further. We propose a three-dimensional framework that integrates cognitive biases into a more comprehensive structure - one that considers not only cognition and emotion but also decision-making phases and temporal orientation.
