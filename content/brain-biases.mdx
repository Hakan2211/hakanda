I was born in 1992, six months before the World Wide Web became accessible to the general public.
Since then, technology has advanced at a breathtaking pace, transforming the way we live, work, and connect.
I watched as wireless phones and cell phones grew smaller and more portable - only for smartphones like the IPhone to completely disrupt how we communicate.
Televisions became slimmer, sharper, and evolved into OLED displays.
Laptops became sleeker and more powerful. Now, generative AI and large language models can write, create, and process at speeds unimaginable just a decade ago.
The environment we live in is changing faster and faster, and this acceleration shows no signs of slowing down.
Yet here's the paradox: while technology leaps forward, our brains remain wired as they were in the Neanderthal era.
They are not equipped to process the sheer volume and velocity of modern information.\
Consider this: every second, our brains receive around 11 bits of sensory information, but we can only consciously process 50 bits per second.
That's like trying to collect a teaspoonful of water from Niagara Falls. The rest is filtered out, leaving us with just a fraction of reality.
To illustrate, imagine a library with 220,000 books, representing all the information our brains receive every second. Out of those books, we'd read just one single word from a single page in one book.
That's how little we consciously process compared to what's available to us.

To manage this overwhelming flood of information, our brains rely on mental shortcuts, or heuristics, to make decisions quickly and efficiently.
However, these shortcuts come at a cost: they often lead to cognitive biases - systematic errors in thinking and judgement that distort our perception of reality.
But the problem isn't just about filtering information and shortcuts. It's also about how our brains are structured.\
The human brain can be divided broadly into three main parts:

<Listcomponent
  type="ordered"
  items={[
    <>
      <strong>The Neocortex:</strong> The rational, thinking brain,
      responsible for logic, reasoning, and higher-level analysis.
    </>,
    <>
      <strong>The Limbic System</strong> (featuring the amygdala): Often called the "emotional brain," this part of your brain handles feelings like fear, pleasure, and anger. It’s also much quicker to react than the more logical neocortex. Take a look at the 3D model below to see the key parts of the limbic system, including the amygdala, hippocampus, and hypothalamus.
      
    </>,
    <>
      <strong>The Brainstem</strong> (also known as the reptilian brain):  The instinctive brain that controls survival functions like fight-or-flight responses and vital bodily processes.
    </>

These three regions often conflict with each other. While the neocortex strives for logic and reason, the limbic system can override it with emotional responses, driven by fear, excitement, or deeply ingrained past experiences.
In a world where technology advances at mind-bowling speed, but our brains evolve at a glacial pace, this internal conflict between rational thought, emotional reaction , and instinct becomes a key driver of cognitive biases.
These biases aren't just quirks of human thinking - they are the byproducts of a brain struggling to adapt to a world it was never designed for.

        Emotions are generated in the limbic system, which is also where our
        desires and drives come from. These emotions and drives help us behave
        in ways that are usually good for our survival. But the limbic system
        isn't just about the amygdala and emotions—it includes several other
        parts, each with its own role. Take the thalamus, for example. It acts
        like a relay station, sending information from our senses to the rest of
        the brain. Just below the thalamus is the hypothalamus, which works
        together with the pituitary gland to regulate and adjust our body,
        helping us adapt to our environment. Then there's the hippocampus, which
        plays a crucial role in forming and storing long-term memories. Before
        information reaches the hippocampus, it passes through the amygdala,
        where emotions like fear and others are created and recorded.

      <h2>The Limbic System: Key parts and their functions</h2>
      <h3>Thalamus (particularly the Anterior Nuclei)</h3>
      <div>
        <b>Sensory Relay:</b> Serves as a relay center for most sensory
        information heading to the cortex
      </div>
      <div>
        <b>Memory and Learning:</b>The anterior nuclei of the thalamus have
        connections with the hippocampus and cingulate cortex, supporting memory
        and attention.
      </div>
      <h3>Hypothalamus</h3>
      <div>
        <b>Homeostasis:</b> Regulates basic bodily functions such as
        temperature, hunger, thirst, sleep, and circadian rhythms.
      </div>
      <div>
        <b>Endocrine Control:</b> Works closely with the pituitary gland to
        release hormones that influence stress responses, growth, and
        metabolism.
      </div>
      <div>
        <b>Motivation and Behavior:</b> Drives behaviors related to survival
        (e.g., eating, mating, stress responses).
      </div>
      <h3>Hippocampus</h3>
      <div>
        <b>Memory Formation and Consolidation:</b> Critical for converting
        short-term memories into long-term memories.
      </div>
      <div>
        <b>Spatial Navigation:</b> Important for mental mapping and navigating
        through the environment.
      </div>
      <h3>Amygdala</h3>
      <div>
        <b>Emotional Processing:</b> Especially involved in fear responses,
        aggression, and other strong emotions.
      </div>
      <div>
        <b>Emotional Memory:</b> Helps in encoding memories that are highly
        charged with emotional content.
      </div>
      <h3>Cingulate Cortex (Cingulate Gyrus)</h3>
      <div>
        <b>Emotional Regulation:</b> Integrates emotional responses with
        cognitive processes, influencing decision-making.
      </div>
      <div>
        <b>Pain Processing:</b> Involved in the emotional aspect of pain
        perception.
      </div>
      <div>
        <b>Behavioral Adaptation:</b> Helps modulate behavior in response to
        changing conditions or emotional states.
      </div>

In the early 1980s, a groundbreaking research field emerged: behavioral finance. Pioneered by Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman, this field demonstrated how cognitive biases unconsciously lead to poor decisions-making.
Their research showed that human judgement is systematically influenced by errors and deviations from rationality. Building on this foundation, researchers like Hersh Shefrin categorized these distortions into groups such as heuristics and framing effects.
While existing works have made significant contributions to understanding cognitive biases, many approaches remain limited to two-dimensional frameworks, focusing on the interplay between cognition and emotion.

In this article, we go a step further. We propose a three-dimensional framework that integrates cognitive biases into a more comprehensive structure - one that considers not only cognition and emotion but also decision-making phases and temporal orientation.
