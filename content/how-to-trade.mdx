Have you ever faced the challenge of mastering a difficult skill?
Have you found yourself investing countless hours and immense effort into the process?
Reflecting on such journeys, you'll notice a common progression through various stages.
From the initial immersion to the steady middle and finally, to the culmination of your efforts,
these stages often mirror each other's experiences.

In the beginning, you gather as much information as possible, seeking to build a solid foundation.
Next, you organize this information, placing it into a context that makes sense to you.
Then comes the crucial phase of filtering out the irrelevant details, honing in on what truly matters.
Finally, you experiment, integrating new knowledge and making connections, continually refining your
understanding through a cycle of trial and error.

This article delves into the third stage of this process, a pivotal point where you cannot afford to discard
any information and must discern what is essential.
This is particularly relevant for traders dealing with small-cap equities.
Let's explore this crucial phase in detail.

## Key variables in a trading framework

Before entering a trade, it is crucial to establish a mental framework that allows you to predict and anticipate potential price movements.
This framework consists of several key variables: the float, the volume, the time, and the price.
The behavior of the equity — its range, volatility, and the speed of its price movements — depends on these variables.
Let's explore each of these elements in detail.

### The float

The float refers to the number of shares available for purchase and sale by
the investing and trading public. When a company is formed, it announces the
total authorized shares, which includes both outstanding shares and restricted
shares. By subtracting the restricted shares from the outstanding shares, you
arrive at the float. It's worth noting that different platforms may report
slightly different figures for the float.<HoverCardWrapper content={<span>When a new ticker pops up on your scanners with a press release, there are several <b>third-party sources</b> to consult for float information. For a quick reference, you can use <Textlink text="DilutionTracker" href="https://dilutiontracker.com/" />. If you need a comparison between common third-party sources, check out <Textlink text="KnowTheFloat" href="https://knowthefloat.com" />. When more time is available or if the numbers seem inconsistent, you can investigate the filings at <Textlink text="BamSEC" href="https://www.bamsec.com/" />. Personally, I use DilutionTracker for a quick glance and fast decisions to make a scalp trade. However, if I am trading a setup like a gap-up short at the open, I always review the filings. When trading with a big-picture strategy, it is essential to plan and prepare thoroughly, which is also true for swing trading. </span>}/>
Minor discrepancies are generally inconsequential. However, significant differences warrant a closer examination of the company's filings to determine the correct number of outstanding shares and to subtract the shares held by insiders.

Generally, there exists an inverse correlation between a stock’s float and its price volatility.
In essence, a lower float often implies a heightened likelihood of broader price ranges and more rapid, aggressive movements.
This relationship is depicted in the graphs below, illustrating the inverse correlation between float and volatility.

<FloatVolatilityCorrelation labelColor="#1c733f" labelFontSize="16px" />

Initially, I plotted only the red graph, but soon realized this might mislead some into interpreting the individual data points too precisely.
For instance, a 20M float showing a 12% price volatility could lead to the argument that higher floats had higher volatility in past financial markets.
To mitigate this, I introduced the dashed blue line.
This addition underscores the dynamic nature of the correlation, illustrating that volatility is influenced not only by float size
but also by various factors such as market cycles and catalysts like positive earnings reports or 'groundbreaking' innovations.
Thus, while the relationship between float size and stock price volatility is fluid and subject to adjustment, the overall trend remains evident.

The market capitalization of companies is often categorized by size, offering a framework for understanding their characteristics.
Unlike market capitalization <TooltipWrapper trigger='?' triggerPosition='-translate-x-1 -translate-y-1' content={<span><b>Market capitalization</b>, often referred to as "<i>market cap</i>," represents the <b>total value</b> of a company as determined by the stock market. This value is <strong>calculated by multiplying the total number of a company’s outstanding shares by the current price per share</strong>. A company’s market cap rises when the share price increases or when the company issues additional shares. Conversely, it falls when the share price declines or when the company repurchases its shares. This measure provides investors with a <b>quick snapshot of a company's size and its market value</b>.</span>} />,
there isn't a universally consistent categorization of equities based on their float size.
Consequently, the classification of different float sizes may vary slightly among traders.
This categorization holds particular significance for me, as it shapes my perception of stocks' liquidity, price range, and volatility.
Below, you will find tables that outline the general market capitalization sizes, ranging from nano cap to mega cap, alongside
my personal classification of float sizes, from nano float to mid float.
I have not included float sizes larger than mid floats, as stocks with larger floats do not significantly impact my trading strategies.
In my experience, the float size is more critical when dealing with smaller to mid-sized stocks, where it can greatly influence price movements
and volatility. For large-cap stocks, other factors take precedence in my trading decisions.

  title="Check the institutional ownership"
  description="When analyzing a company's stock float, it is crucial to consider the institutional ownership. High institutional ownership can lead to a lower float since institutions often hold substantial blocks of shares. When using tools like DilutionTracker, you should subtract institutional ownership (I/O) from the total float to get an accurate measure. Understanding I/O can help you avoid unexpected behaviors where a stock acts like a low-float stock, even if you expected it to behave like a mid-float stock.
  However, it's important to note that even with accurate float calculations, stock behavior can still vary. The float does not guarantee or predict the stock's behavior with complete certainty. Instead, it offers a framework for understanding potential movements and characteristics. The float should be seen as a guide to what is possible and how the stock might behave, rather than a definitive predictor."

Below, you will find a 3D Environment Canvas that I have created. You can zoom in
and out, as well as move the camera, by left-clicking, holding, and dragging the
cursor. I hope this interactive widget brings the topic to life, making it more tangible
and engaging.

In this canvas, you will see three differently sized boxes, each labeled to reflect its size.
The green box labeled "10M" is ten times larger than the red box labeled "1M," and the yellow box labeled "50M" is five times larger than
the green box. Click on either the boxes or their labels and observe how the boxes move. Pay close attention to the damping effect at the end
of their motion, and notice how far they rebound before settling back. Enjoy exploring this interactive experience for a few moments!
