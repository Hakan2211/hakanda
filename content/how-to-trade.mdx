Have you ever faced the challenge of mastering a difficult skill?
Have you found yourself investing countless hours and immense effort into the process?
Reflecting on such journeys, you'll notice a common progression through various stages.
From the initial immersion to the steady middle and finally, to the culmination of your efforts,
these stages often mirror each other's experiences.

In the beginning, you gather as much information as possible, seeking to build a solid foundation.
Next, you organize this information, placing it into a context that makes sense to you.
Then comes the crucial phase of filtering out the irrelevant details, honing in on what truly matters.
Finally, you experiment, integrating new knowledge and making connections, continually refining your
understanding through a cycle of trial and error.

This article delves into the third stage of this process, a pivotal point where you cannot afford to discard
any information and must discern what is essential.
This is particularly relevant for traders dealing with small-cap equities.
Let's explore this crucial phase in detail.

## Key variables in a trading framework

Before entering a trade, it is crucial to establish a mental framework that allows you to predict and anticipate potential price movements.
This framework consists of several key variables: the float, the volume, the time, and the price.
The behavior of the equity—its range, volatility, and the speed of its price movements—depends on these variables.
Let's explore each of these elements in detail.

### The float

The float refers to the number of shares available for purchase and sale by
the investing and trading public. When a company is formed, it announces the
total authorized shares, which includes both outstanding shares and restricted
shares. By subtracting the restricted shares from the outstanding shares, you
arrive at the float. It's worth noting that different platforms may report
slightly different figures for the float. Minor discrepancies are generally
inconsequential. However, significant differences warrant a closer examination
of the company’s filings to determine the correct number of outstanding shares
and to subtract the shares held by insiders.<HoverCardWrapper content={<div><p>When a new ticker pops up on your scanners with a press release, there are several third-party sources to consult for float information.

Generally, there exists an inverse correlation between a stock’s float and its price volatility.
In essence, a lower float often implies a heightened likelihood of broader price ranges and more rapid, aggressive movements.
This relationship is depicted in the graph below, illustrating the inverse correlation between float and volatility.
