Have you ever faced the challenge of mastering a difficult skill?
Have you found yourself investing countless hours and immense effort into the process?
Reflecting on such journeys, you'll notice a common progression through various stages.
From the initial immersion to the steady middle and finally, to the culmination of your efforts,
these stages often mirror each other's experiences.

In the beginning, you gather as much information as possible, seeking to build a solid foundation.
Next, you organize this information, placing it into a context that makes sense to you.
Then comes the crucial phase of filtering out the irrelevant details, honing in on what truly matters.
Finally, you experiment, integrating new knowledge and making connections, continually refining your
understanding through a cycle of trial and error.

This article examines the third stage of this process, a pivotal point where you cannot afford to discard
any information and must discern what is essential.
This is particularly relevant for traders dealing with small-cap equities.
Let's explore this crucial phase in detail.

## Key variables in a trading framework

Before entering a trade, it is crucial to establish a mental framework that allows you to predict and anticipate potential price movements.
This framework consists of several key variables: the float, the volume, the time, and the price.
The behavior of the equity — its range, volatility, and the speed of its price movements — depends on these variables.
Let's explore each of these elements in detail.

### The float

The float refers to the number of shares available for purchase and sale by
the investing and trading public. When a company is formed, it announces the
total authorized shares, which includes both outstanding shares and restricted
shares. By subtracting the restricted shares from the outstanding shares, you
arrive at the float. It's worth noting that different platforms may report
slightly different figures for the float.<HoverCardWrapper content={<span>When a new ticker pops up on your scanners with a press release, there are several <b>third-party sources</b> to consult for float information. For a quick reference, you can use <Textlink text="DilutionTracker" href="https://dilutiontracker.com/" />. If you need a comparison between common third-party sources, check out <Textlink text="KnowTheFloat" href="https://knowthefloat.com" />. When more time is available or if the numbers seem inconsistent, you can investigate the filings at <Textlink text="BamSEC" href="https://www.bamsec.com/" />. Personally, I use DilutionTracker for a quick glance and fast decisions to make a scalp trade. However, if I am trading a setup like a gap-up short at the open, I always review the filings. When trading with a big-picture strategy, it is essential to plan and prepare thoroughly, which is also true for swing trading. </span>}/>
Minor discrepancies are generally inconsequential. However, significant differences warrant a closer examination of the company's filings to determine the correct number of outstanding shares and to subtract the shares held by insiders.

        ]}
      />

Generally, there exists an inverse correlation between a stock’s float and its price volatility.
In essence, a lower float often implies a heightened likelihood of broader price ranges and more rapid, aggressive movements.
This relationship is depicted in the graphs below, illustrating the inverse correlation between float and volatility.

<FloatVolatilityCorrelation labelColor="#1c733f" labelFontSize="16px" />

Initially, I plotted only the red graph, but soon realized this might mislead some into interpreting the individual data points too precisely.
For instance, a 20M float showing a 12% price volatility could lead to the argument that higher floats had higher volatility in past financial markets.
To mitigate this, I introduced the dashed blue line.
This addition underscores the dynamic nature of the correlation, illustrating that volatility is influenced not only by float size
but also by various factors such as market cycles and catalysts like positive earnings reports or 'groundbreaking' innovations.
Thus, while the relationship between float size and stock price volatility is fluid and subject to adjustment, the overall trend remains evident.

The market capitalization of companies is often categorized by size, offering a framework for understanding their characteristics.
Unlike market capitalization <TooltipWrapper trigger='?' triggerPosition='-translate-x-1 -translate-y-1' content={<span><b>Market capitalization</b>, often referred to as "<i>market cap</i>," represents the <b>total value</b> of a company as determined by the stock market. This value is <strong>calculated by multiplying the total number of a company’s outstanding shares by the current price per share</strong>. A company’s market cap rises when the share price increases or when the company issues additional shares. Conversely, it falls when the share price declines or when the company repurchases its shares. This measure provides investors with a <b>quick snapshot of a company's size and its market value</b>.</span>} />,
there isn't a universally consistent categorization of equities based on their float size.
Consequently, the classification of different float sizes may vary slightly among traders.
This categorization holds particular significance for me, as it shapes my perception of stocks' liquidity, price range, and volatility.
Below, you will find tables that outline the general market capitalization sizes, ranging from nano cap to mega cap, alongside
my personal classification of float sizes, from nano float to mid float.
I have not included float sizes larger than mid floats, as stocks with larger floats do not significantly impact my trading strategies.
In my experience, the float size is more critical when dealing with smaller to mid-sized stocks, where it can greatly influence price movements
and volatility. For large-cap stocks, other factors take precedence in my trading decisions.

  title="Check the institutional ownership"
  description="When analyzing a company's stock float, it is crucial to consider the institutional ownership. High institutional ownership can lead to a lower float since institutions often hold substantial blocks of shares. When using tools like DilutionTracker, you should subtract institutional ownership (I/O) from the total float to get an accurate measure. Understanding I/O can help you avoid unexpected behaviors where a stock acts like a low-float stock, even if you expected it to behave like a mid-float stock.
  However, it's important to note that even with accurate float calculations, stock behavior can still vary. The float does not guarantee or predict the stock's behavior with complete certainty. Instead, it offers a framework for understanding potential movements and characteristics. The float should be seen as a guide to what is possible and how the stock might behave, rather than a definitive predictor."

and out, as well as move the camera, by left-clicking, holding, and dragging the
cursor. I hope this interactive widget brings the topic to life, making it more tangible
and engaging.

In this canvas, you will see three differently sized boxes, each labeled to reflect its size.
The green box labeled "10M" is ten times larger than the red box labeled "1M," and the yellow box labeled "50M" is five times larger than
the green box. Click on either the boxes or their labels and observe how the boxes move. Pay close attention to the damping effect at the end
of their motion, and notice how far they rebound before settling back. Enjoy exploring this interactive experience for a few moments!

While the float does not directly affect the calculation of market capitalization,
it can influence the stock price, which in turn impacts the market cap.
A significant retail trader, a group of retail traders, or an institution can manipulate the stock price
by locking up a portion of the freely tradable float. You can't verify if a part of the float has been locked by consulting third-party sources.

I assume these traders adopt a systematic approach in choosing which stocks to manipulate.
The criteria might include the 'right' float range, their accumulation ratio (float locking) relative to the float, and the stock price.
The float should neither be too small nor too large. A small float, when partially locked, becomes even smaller,
leading to excessive volatility that might deter retail traders. Conversely, a float that is too large would be difficult to influence significantly.
The accumulation ratio must also be carefully balanced. If too small, traders have less control over supply and demand.
If too large, the remaining free float becomes overly volatile, again discouraging average retail traders.
These traders might use a specific formula or prefer certain values based on past success.
If I were to choose, I would consider a float of 3M - 8M, an accumulation ratio of 50%-70%, and a stock price range of $1 - $4.
However, this is speculative and cannot be proven with certainty.

Selecting a 50% - 70% float locking ratio allows sufficient control over supply and demand without overwhelming influence from retail traders.
For example, locking 3M shares of a 5M float stock balances control and volatility.
Lower stock prices require less capital to accumulate the float, making risk management easier and allowing risk distribution across multiple accounts
in a group setting.
Consider a stock priced at $1. Ten accounts could accumulate 300k shares each.
Retail traders might believe they are trading a 5M float stock, unaware that 3M shares are locked,
effectively reducing the tradable float to 2M and altering volatility expectations.
The float rotates faster than retail traders anticipate, attracting more traders emotionally as they witness rapid turnover.
High float rotation can lead to unpredictable stock prices and extreme price swings.
Thus, traders should be aware of float rotation when dealing with small float stocks and recognize when a stock's movement does not align with its float,
indicating possible float locking.

Companies may also pay groups of retail traders to manipulate stock prices higher, attracting other retail traders to buy.
The manipulation technique involves splitting the float into locked and freely tradable portions, stealthily accumulating shares,
and creating hype and momentum through chat rooms and social media. They may spread rumors or release news to trigger technical indicators,
such as breaking resistance levels, attracting technical retail traders.
The resulting rapid price increase induces FOMO <TooltipWrapper trigger='?' content={<span className="text-center"><b>Fear Of Missing Out</b> isn't limited to trading. It affects people across all professions and walks of life, influencing their decision-making and emotions. For instance, individuals may feel pressured to marry, buy houses, or have children because they see their peers doing so, despite not being ready themselves. This often leads to rushing into relationships or making hasty decisions driven by FOMO. Such decisions rarely yield positive outcomes. Instead, it's crucial to take a step back, breathe, and carefully consider your choices without the influence of FOMO.</span>} /> among retail traders, who buy emotionally.
Manipulators then gradually sell their shares, maintaining the illusion of a continuing rally.
Once the price reaches a significant high, they dump large quantities of shares, causing the price to plummet.
This method is reminiscent of the <Textlink href='https://www.timothysykes.com/blog/7-step-pennystocking-framework/' text='7-step pennystocking framework'/> by <Twitterlink href='https://twitter.com/timothysykes'>Timothy Sykes</Twitterlink>, which visualizes how emotional responses shape chart patterns.

In nature, you can observe how animals use techniques to hunt their prey.
One of my favorite animals is the orca, or killer whale. In the video below,
you can watch how they break the ice with subsurface waves, creating smaller pieces and generating bubbles to disorient their prey, such as seals.
I love watching animal documentaries, especially those focusing on hunting and survival techniques. When I saw this video,
it reminded me to the float manipulation technique, where the float is broken into a smaller piece and 'bubbles' are created to disorient retail traders.

      During my university years, I worked three jobs to pay my tuition fees.
      One of these jobs was as a logistician at the football stadium of a
      Bundesliga club, earning $10 per hour. Although it wasn't the best
      financial decision, it taught me the value of money and hard work. Back
      then, I had no idea I would become a full-time trader. I only loved
      studying the markets and building a long-term portfolio with the little
      money I managed to save. However, two important lessons stayed with me
      from that time. Inside the stadium, there were twenty food shops in the
      mid-section area where people could buy beer, soft drinks, fries,
      schnitzels, and sausages. My job was to prepare the inventory for these
      shops before the game, fill the main warehouse, and restock the shops when
      they sold out. It was a stressful and exhausting ten-hour job. I would
      arrive 5 - 6 hours before the game started, work through the 1.5-hour
      game, and stay another 2 - 3 hours afterward to return the beer barrels,
      count the inventory, restock the warehouse, and change the oil for the
      fryers for the next game. Being at the stadium so early, I observed the
      ebb and flow of people. Security controlled the crowd before entry, and
      people arrived at different times - some 10 minutes and others an hour
      before the game. The stadium filled gradually, but the exit was swift once
      the game ended. Watching the crowd exit simultaneously from the top of the
      stadium was quite a sight.{' '}
      <span className="underline underline-offset-2">
        This experience led to two thoughts that have stayed with me.
      </span>
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      <b>
        First, creating and building something takes much longer than destroying
        or quitting.
        <br></br>
        Second, I imagined the stadium as a microcosm of our world: people are born,
        live, and then die, making way for the next generation. We are here for a
        brief period, whether as spectators, workers, or something else, and must
        leave to allow others to take our place.
      </b>
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      Years later, when observing the cycles of small-cap stocks, another
      thought struck me. I imagined each spectator as a trader, buying and
      selling items in the stadium to make a profit. How many would be
      profitable when they left the stadium? One thing was clear: people need to
      be smart or lucky to make a profit. And what about the companies that
      prepared and sold the items? They were the real winners. Imagine if people
      traded only during the 90 minutes of the game, when emotions and crowd
      dynamics were at their peak, rather than before or after the game.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      Have you ever had an experience that you later compared to something else,
      creating an analogy or metaphor that gave you a new perspective or a better
      understanding? I'd love to hear your stories and insights.

### The volume

Volume stands as a vital indicator for predicting price movements in the stock market.
Its significance cannot be overstated, and while entire books could be devoted to its intricacies,
I aim to offer a distilled yet comprehensive overview.
The task of selecting which aspects to cover was daunting, given the vastness of the topic.
However, this article aims to provide a clear and concise understanding,
offering a glimpse into the complexities that underlie volume analysis.

Volume can be examined independently or as a complementary tool to price action analysis.
Every proficient trader I know keeps volume charts alongside price candlesticks.
Volume is a universal metric, utilized across all markets — stocks, futures, options,
commodities, and even forex. Mastering the interpretation of volume and its interplay with price action,
governed by the laws of demand and supply, equips one with the ability to navigate any market.
These fundamental laws are ubiquitous, explaining the recurring patterns seen in different trading arenas.

<Textlink
  text="Charles Dow’s"
  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Dow"
/> theory is indispensable for anyone serious about trading. He introduced the concept
of volume-price confirmation and anomalies. According to Dow, a price move backed
by rising volume is considered valid. Conversely, a price move on low volume is deemed
an anomaly, indicating underlying issues. Comparing volume candles with price candles
in terms of their size and length is beneficial. Ideally, the largest price candle
should align with the largest volume candle, reflecting the strength of the move.
This idea resonates with Richard Wyckoff’s “law of cause and effect,” which asserts
that the magnitude of the effect is proportional to the cause. Thus, significant
causes yield substantial effects, while minor causes result in minor effects.

<AlertText
variant="info"
description={
<span>
<Textlink text='Richard Wyckoff' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Wyckoff' /> introduced three fundamental laws that govern the market. 
Each of these laws can be likened to natural phenomena, making them easier to comprehend and remember.
<br></br>
<br></br>
<strong>The Law of Supply and Demand:</strong>
<br></br>
Much like the ebb and flow of tides, the market reacts
to the balance between supply and demand. When demand surpasses supply, prices naturally rise to satiate this demand.
Conversely, when supply exceeds demand, prices fall, absorbing the excess. Imagine a bustling marketplace:
when everyone clamors for a rare item, its price skyrockets.
But when the market is flooded with goods, prices plummet to clear the stalls.
<br></br>
<br></br>
<strong>The Law of Cause and Effect:</strong>
<br></br>
This law is reminiscent of planting a seed and harvesting its fruits. 
For every effect in the market, there must be an initiating cause, 
and the magnitude of the effect is directly proportional to the cause. 
Picture a farmer: 
the quality and quantity of the harvest directly correlate to the effort and care put into sowing and nurturing the crops.
<br></br>
<br></br>
<strong>The Law of Effort and Result:</strong>
<br></br>
Comparable to the principles of physics, this law states that every action in the market must produce a corresponding reaction. 
The price movements on the chart should mirror the volume activity below. Just as in nature, 
where a stone thrown into a pond creates ripples, in the market, volume (effort) creates price action (result). 
The two should resonate in harmony, with the volume being the force that drives the consequent price action.

</span>}

Despite the opacity often associated with stock markets,
due to factors like high-frequency trading algorithms, insider trading, and dilution,
volume remains a transparent metric. Volume data, including the number of shares traded and their prices,
is accessible to all. This visibility allows traders to identify historical demand and supply zones,
revealing where the market has accumulated or distributed shares.

A distinction exists between small-cap and large-cap stocks.
Large-cap stocks generally exhibit high, consistent volume and liquidity.
In contrast, small-cap stocks often experience sporadic volume spikes triggered by catalysts
such as favorable news, unexpectedly good earnings reports, or groundbreaking technological advancements.
While such catalysts also affect large-cap stocks, the key difference lies in the pre-existing
high volume in large caps before the catalyst event. Small caps typically show little liquidity beforehand.
Traders like <Twitterlink href='https://x.com/pradeepbonde'>Pradeep Bonde</Twitterlink> focus on these momentum bursts and episodic pivot plays driven by positive catalysts.

In stock trading, understanding liquidity traps, clearing house buy-ins, and the dynamics of short selling
is crucial for grasping market behavior and stability.
A liquidity trap occurs when an asset becomes difficult to trade without significantly
impacting its price, often due to a lack of willing buyers or sellers.
This can lead to rapid price movements if a large number of shares are suddenly traded.
Clearing houses ensure smooth trade settlements. A buy-in happens when a seller fails to deliver sold shares by the settlement date,
prompting the clearing house to purchase the necessary shares to fulfill the buyer's order.
Failures to deliver (FTDs) occur when a seller cannot provide the security by the settlement date,
which can result from logistical issues or intentional short selling without securing the shares.
Persistent FTDs attract regulatory scrutiny and potential penalties.
To address FTDs, clearing houses initiate buy-ins to ensure buyers receive their shares.
Short sellers can become trapped when they cannot close their positions due to a lack of
available shares or rising prices, leading to a short squeeze.
This forces short sellers to buy back shares to cover their positions, further driving up the price.
In a liquidity trap,
the scarcity of shares exacerbates this issue, potentially leading to forced buy-ins by clearing houses.
Frequent FTDs signal a shortage of available shares, creating a liquidity trap that complicates
trading without causing significant price movements. Short sellers contribute to FTDs when
they cannot deliver shares, prompting clearing houses to conduct buy-ins. During a short squeeze,
rising prices force short sellers to cover their positions, leading to more FTDs and additional buy-ins.
This cycle of FTDs, buy-ins, and liquidity issues results in extreme price volatility and market instability.

  title="The Distinction Between High Volume and Liquidity"
  description={
    <span>
      <b>High Volume</b>
      <br></br>
      Trading volume signifies the sheer number of shares or contracts exchanged
      in a given period, typically measured daily. A surge in volume suggests a heightened
      level of interest and participation, often spurred by pivotal news, earnings
      reports, or other significant events. High volume indicates that a multitude
      of buyers and sellers are engaged in the market, contributing to dynamic price
      movements. Such environments can be ripe with opportunities as traders react
      to the influx of new information.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      <b>Liquidity</b>
      <br></br>
      Liquidity, on the other hand, pertains to the ease with which an asset can be bought or 
      sold without causing a substantial change in its price. 
      A liquid market is characterized by a sufficient number of buyers and sellers,
      ensuring that large transactions can be executed smoothly and swiftly. 
      The hallmark of high liquidity is its ability to stabilize prices, mitigating 
      the risk of sharp, unwelcome fluctuations.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      <b>Distinguishing Factors</b>
      <br></br>
      The distinction between volume and liquidity becomes apparent when examining their measurements and implications. 
      Volume is quantifiable by the number of trades, offering a snapshot of market activity. Liquidity, however, 
      is gauged by the market's capacity to absorb trades with minimal impact on prices, highlighting the quality 
      and depth of market participation. For traders, these differences are crucial. High volume may signal robust 
      activity and potential volatility, enticing those who thrive on market movements. Conversely, high liquidity is a beacon 
      for those seeking to execute large trades with minimal disruption, ensuring lower transaction costs and greater price stability.
      It is essential not to conflate high volume with high liquidity. A market teeming with trades does not automatically guarantee ease of transaction.
      A stock might exhibit high volume but remain susceptible to significant price swings if buyer-seller imbalances persist. 
      Similarly, a highly liquid market may offer stable prices and tight bid-ask spreads but not necessarily experience high trading volumes
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      <b>The Importance of Clarity</b>
      <br></br>
      Confusing volume with liquidity can lead to flawed trading strategies and increased risk. Entering a high-volume market under the mistaken
       belief of inherent liquidity might result in unexpected price impacts and transaction difficulties. 
       Conversely, recognizing the nuances of liquidity helps in navigating markets with precision, particularly in managing risk 
       and ensuring efficient execution of trades.
    </span>

/>

On the first day of a news or catalyst release, stocks can be subject to manipulation.
To navigate this, I estimate the volume likely to be transacted by the end of the day to calculate the float rotation.
This helps guide my decisions compared to the expected volume.
Recognizing volume soaking at key levels is also crucial, especially when moves get repeatedly soaked.
Observing manipulation when highs or lows are cleared out, stuffed, and soaked again at higher prices is essential.<br></br><Twitterlink href="https://twitter.com/TradetheMatrix1">Tradethematrix</Twitterlink> has categorized rigged stocks and their manipulation into four types, offering valuable insights for any trader.

  Be mindful that not every dip to key price levels followed by a subsequent recovery should be considered a trap.
  It is essential to examine your biases and question the current market environment and cycle.
  Often, traders with a short bias lament rebounds as deceptive actions, but in truth, their biases are skewing their perception.
  I have observed this tendency among short-biased traders, who frequently misinterpret market bounces as false signals. 
  In reality, these movements are not inherently deceptive; rather, it is the traders' own prejudices 
  that distort their understanding of the market dynamics.
  </span>
}

In conclusion, understanding and analyzing volume is essential for successful trading.
By grasping the interplay of various market dynamics and employing practical strategies,
traders can navigate the complexities of the stock market with greater confidence and insight.

### The time

The concept of time, when added to the variables of volume and price, transforms a chart into a three-dimensional representation.
For me, studying time in this context is both the most exhilarating and the most challenging aspect.
Like with the volume chapter, I found it necessary to be selective to maintain the focus of this article.

Time, one of the seven SI base units <TooltipWrapper trigger={'\*'} content={<Listcomponent type='unordered' items={['time in second','length in metre','mass in kilogram','electric current in ampere','thermodynamic temperature in kelvin', 'amount of substance in mole', 'luminous intensity in candela' ]} />} />, is universally experienced. Everyone has 24 hours a day and seven days a week,
moving at a constant pace. Yet, our perception of time can vary significantly depending on our emotions and circumstances.
When entertained or challenged, time may seem to fly, while in moments of boredom or distress, it can drag interminably.

In trading, we utilize various timeframes on charts, ranging from short to long resolutions.
Commonly, traders refer to 1-minute, 5-minute, 15-minute, 30-minute, 60-minute, daily, weekly, and monthly timeframes.
Larger timeframes provide a broader perspective, revealing overall trends and critical support and resistance areas.
Smaller timeframes are used to implement detailed analyses derived from these broader views.
However, shorter timeframes have a higher noise-to-signal ratio, making it easy to be misled without the context of longer timeframes.

Experienced traders have witnessed and navigated multiple market cycles. <Textlink text="Ralph Nelson Elliott's" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Nelson_Elliott"/> wave theory, which posits that markets move in patterns of five and three waves
within a trend, underscores the cyclical nature of market psychology, swinging between
optimism and pessimism. Elliott's theory, incorporating the Fibonacci sequence and
the golden ratio, describes these waves as fractal and multi-periodic.

Understanding the interplay between large-cap and small-cap cycles is crucial.
Large-cap cycles influence and often precede small-cap cycles, with money flowing from more stable assets to riskier,
more volatile ones. A weak large-cap cycle typically leads to a subdued small-cap environment,
as investors withdraw funds or refrain from investing in riskier assets. Conversely,
a robust large-cap market often signals a forthcoming surge in small-cap activity, albeit with a time lag.
Multiple small-cap cycles can occur within a single large-cap cycle.<br></br>
The graph below illustrates this theory. The yellow and green graphs depict that
multiple small-cap cycles (yellow) can fit within a single large-cap cycle
(green). The blue and red graphs show that small-cap cycles follow large-cap
cycles in rising markets. During weak large-cap cycles, small-cap activity tends
to be flat and less active.

<CyclesPlot labelColor="#1c733f" labelFontSize="16px" />

Tracking factors that influence big-cap cycles, such as US bonds, bond yields, the US dollar, and economic indicators like
the Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions and inflation data, is essential.
This broader view helps in forming an informed perspective rather than relying solely on ETF-related assets like SPY and IWM.

Small-cap stocks thrive in a strong overall market, where gains from big caps are often reinvested.
However, small caps have distinct cycles influenced by news-driven "runners" that tend to spike and fade
throughout the day. This pattern has led many traders to adopt a short bias, anticipating declines post-peak. Over time,
aggressive shorting can lead to dramatic short squeezes, where the stock price skyrockets as short sellers rush to cover their positions.
This, in turn, fuels FOMO among traders, who then chase rising stocks,
often resulting in rapid gains followed by swift declines.
This cycle repeats as traders recalibrate their strategies.

        Time also plays a critical role in the speed of buying and selling. In
        the video below, it is explained how selling slowly can prevent a rapid
        price drop. This strategy highlights the importance of timing in trade
        execution, as the speed of transactions can significantly impact market
        prices.

Some traders make decisions based on daily time-specific patterns. Here is an interactive widget I prepared:
by pressing the times on the clock, you can explore the different trading activities throughout the day.<TooltipWrapper trigger={"\*"} content={<span>Every trader has their own specific observations and time slots.

Additionally, there are several seasonal trends that savvy investors track and trade,
offering significant advantages when understood and leveraged effectively.

During election years, stock market volatility often increases due to uncertainty over potential policy changes.
Small-cap stocks, in particular, can be highly sensitive to shifts in regulations and economic policies influenced by election outcomes.
For example, in the United States, small caps have historically shown a tendency to rally in the months following presidential elections,
especially if the results favor pro-business policies.

Seasonal demand for commodities also impacts market trends. Gold prices, for instance, tend to rise during the summer months
due to increased demand from India, where gold is traditionally purchased for weddings and festivals. Similarly,
the demand for chocolate peaks during the winter holidays such as Christmas and Valentine’s Day,
driving up prices and potentially benefiting small-cap companies in the confectionery industry.
Agricultural cycles can also affect prices, such as wheat, where a poor harvest one year can lead to higher prices the next,
impacting small-cap stocks in the agricultural sector.

The adage "Sell in May and go away" is based on the historical underperformance of the market during the summer months,
suggesting that investors should sell their stocks in May and re-enter the market in October. Small-cap stocks,
which are often more volatile, might experience more pronounced seasonal effects.
Historical data indicates that small caps often underperform during the summer and tend to rally in the fall and winter.

Retail stocks, particularly small-cap retailers, often see significant increases in sales during the holiday season,
such as Black Friday and Christmas. This boost in sales can lead to stock price increases,
as strong holiday sales are reflected in earnings reports released in the first quarter of the following year.
Similarly, the back-to-school season in late summer can lead to higher sales for small-cap companies in the retail and apparel sectors,
positively impacting their stock prices due to increased sales volumes during this period.

Lastly, the tax season around the April tax filing deadline can influence consumer spending and saving behaviors.
Small-cap financial services companies often see increased business from tax preparation services and related financial products,
with companies providing tax-related software and services experiencing a spike in sales leading up to the filing deadline.
Understanding these seasonal trends and their impact on small-cap stocks can provide investors with valuable insights and opportunities
for strategic trading.

### The price

The price is the crucial subject in trading. The preceding chapters on float, volume, and time are merely tools to aid in
forecasting or determining future price movements, whether in the short or long term.
Ultimately, if you can buy low and sell high, or sell high and cover low, you are making money, and that is the essence of trading.

To determine the price, you need to decide on the type of trade you are entering. Almost every price action ties into three fundamental concepts:

<Listcomponent
  type="ordered"
  items={[
    'Reversal Plays/Price: This relates to the support and resistance theory.',
    'Trend Continuation: These are breakout plays.',
    'Consolidation: This involves range or oscillation plays',
  ]}
/>

Traders can be divided into three groups: buyers, sellers, and the undecided, who wait on the sidelines.
Buyers aim to pay as little as possible, while sellers seek to charge as much as they can.
This conflict is reflected in bid-ask spreads. A buyer can either wait for prices to drop or pay what sellers demand.
Similarly, a seller can wait for prices to rise or accept a lower offer.
A trade occurs when there is a momentary meeting of buyer and seller.
The presence of undecided traders adds pressure on both bulls and bears.
Buyers and sellers must act swiftly, aware that undecided traders may step in and snatch away their deals at any moment.
A buyer knows that if he hesitates, another trader might buy ahead of him.
A seller knows that if he holds out for a higher price, another trader might sell at a lower price.
This crowd of undecided traders makes buyers and sellers more willing to negotiate with each other.
Each trade represents a meeting of minds. Every price reflects a momentary consensus of value among all market participants,
expressed through action. Prices are created by masses of traders — buyers, sellers, and the undecided.
The patterns of prices and volumes reflect the mass psychology of the market.
