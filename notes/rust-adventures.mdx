Started learning Rust. The borrow checker is strict but fair. It forces you to think about memory ownership in a way that higher-level languages abstract away.

I'm building a small CLI tool to help with file organization. The syntax is expressive, and `match` statements are a joy to use.

```rust
match input {
    Some(val) => println!("Value: {}", val),
    None => println!("No value"),
}
```

The error messages in the Rust compiler are the best I've ever seen. They actually explain what's wrong and often suggest the fix.

Performance is obviously great, but the tooling (Cargo) is what really stands out compared to the C++ ecosystem.
