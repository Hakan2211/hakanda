React Server Components (RSC) are a paradigm shift. Moving logic to the server reduces the client bundle size significantly.

The mental model shift is the hardest part. Thinking in terms of "Server Component" vs "Client Component" boundaries takes some getting used to.

### Key Benefits:
- **Zero Bundle Size**: Server components don't add to the JS bundle.
- **Direct Database Access**: You can query your DB directly in your component.
- **Automatic Code Splitting**: Client components imported by server components are automatically code-split.

I'm experimenting with moving our heavy charting library to be server-rendered where possible, or at least lazy-loaded more effectively.
