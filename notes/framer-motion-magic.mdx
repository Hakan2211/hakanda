Layout animations in Framer Motion are incredibly powerful. The `layout` prop makes list reordering and expansion animations trivial.

Today's experiment was creating a shared layout animation between two different components on different pages. The `layoutId` prop handles the cross-component transition seamlessly.

```javascript
<motion.div layoutId="underline" className="absolute bottom-0 w-full h-1 bg-blue-500" />
```

This simple line of code creates a morphing underline that follows the active navigation item. Top-tier UX with minimal effort.

Remember to set `layout` on the parent container as well if you want the surrounding content to animate smoothly when an element changes size.
