Explored the importance of consistent color palettes in design systems today. It's fascinating how a subtle shift in hue can change the entire perception of a brand.

I've been looking at how Linear and Vercel handle their dark modes. The key seems to be in the subtle borders and the very faint background gradients that provide depth without being overwhelming.

When building a component library, one must consider:
1. **Consistency**: Using CSS variables or tokens.
2. **Accessibility**: Ensuring contrast ratios meet WCAG standards.
3. **Flexibility**: Components should be composable.

I plan to refactor the button components next week to use a slot-based architecture, which should give us more flexibility without bloating the props interface.
